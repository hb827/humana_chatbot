The HER-2/neu oncoFene is a member of the erbB-like
oncogene family, and aS related to, but distinct firom, the
epidermal growth factor receptr. This gene has been
shown to be amplified i human brt cancer cell lines.
In the current study, alterations of the gene in 189
primary human breast cancers were instigated HER-2/
neu was found to be amplified frm 2- to eater than 20-
fold in 30% of the tumors. Correlation ofgene amplifica-
tion with several disease parameters was evaluated Am-
plification of the HER-2/neu gene was a significant pre-
dictor of both overall survival and time to relapse in
patients with breast cancer. It retained its significance
even when adjustments were made for other known
prognostic factors. Moreover, HER-2/neu amplification
had greater prognostic value than most currently used
prognostic factors, incuding hormonal-receptor status,
in lymph node-positive disease. These data indicate that
thbis gene may lay a role in the biologic behavior and/or
pathogenesis human breast cancer.
HE EVIDENCE LINKING PROTO-ONCOGENES TO THE INDUC-
tion or maintenance of human malignancies is largely cir-
cumstantial, but has become increasingly compelling. This
circumstantial evidence is derived from studies of animal models,
tumor cell lines, and actual human tumors. Data from animal models
and cell lines include: (i) sequence homology between human proto-
oncogenes and the viral oncogenes of transforming retroviruses that
are known to be tumorigenic in some species (1, 2); (ii) transfction
studies showing the transforming potential of proto-oncogenes m
NIH 3T3 cells and primary embryo fibroblasts (3-5); and (iii) the
central role of certain proto-oncogenes in tumorigenesis by chronic
transforming retroviruses such as avian leukosis virus (6). Data from
human tumors include: (i) increased expression of specific proto-
oncogenes in some human malignancies (7, 8); (ii) localization of
proto-oncogenes at or near the site of specific, tumor-associated
chromosomal translocations (9); and (iii) amplification of proto-
oncogenes in some human tumors (10, 11).
Additional data linking proto-oncogenes to cell growth is their
expression in response to certain proliferation signals (12, 13) and
their expression during embryonic development (14, 15). More
direct evidence comes from the fact that, of the 20 known proto- Discussion Feb. 1, 2007

transforming gene of the simian sarcoma virus and is the 1B chain of
platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) (16, 17); c-fis, which is
homologous to the transforming gene of the feline sarcoma virus
7002
and is closely related to the macrophage colony-stimulating factor
receptor (CSF-1R) (18); and c-erbB, which encodes the EGF
receptor (EGFR) and is highly homologous to the transforming ,51
gene of the avian erythroblastosis virus (19). The two receptor-
yraunaJ
related proto-oncogenes, c-fins and c-erbB, are members of the
tyrosine-specific protein kinase family to which many proto-onco-
genes belong.
Recently, a novel transforming gene was identified as a result of no
transfction studies with DNA from chemically induced rat neu- gro.gamecneics.www
roglioblastomas (20). This gene, called neu, was shown to be related
to, but distinct from, the c-erbB proto-oncogene (21). By means of
v-erbB and human EGFR as probes to screen human genomic and
complementary DNA (cDNA) libraries, two other groups indepen-
dently isolated human erbB-related genes that they called HER-2
(22) and c-erbB-2 (23). Subsequent sequence analysis and chromo-
somal mapping studies revealed all three genes (neu, c-erbB-2, and
HER-2) to be the same (22, 24, 25). A fourth group, also using v-
erbB as a probe, identified the same gene in a mammary carcinoma morf
cell line, MAC 117, where it was found to be amplified five- to ten-
fold (26). dedaolnwoD
This gene, which we will call HER-2/neu, encodes a new member
of the tyrosine kinase family; and is dosely related to, but distinct
from, the EGFR gene (22). HER-2/neu differs from EGFR in that it
is found on band q21 of chromosome 17 (22, 24, 25), as compared
to band pll.-p13 of chromosome 7, where the EGFR gene is
located (27). Also, the HER-2/neu gene generates a messenger
RNA (mRNA) of 4.8 kb (22), which differs from the 5.8- and 10-
kb transcipts for the EGFR gene (28). Finally, the protein encoded
by the HER-2/neu gene is 185,000 daltons (21), as compared to the
170,000-dalton protein encoded by the EGFR gene. Conversely, on
the basis of sequence data, HER-2/neu is more closely related to the
EGFR gene than to other members of the tyrosine kinase family
(22). Like the EGFR protem, HER-2/neu has an extracellular
domain, a transmembrane domain that includes two cysteine-rich
repeat dusters, and an intracellular kinase domain (21), indicating

that it too is likely to be a cellular receptor for an as yet unidentified
ligand.
As a result of the published data showing amplification of HER-
2/neu in a human mammary carcinoma cell line, and as part of an
ongoing survey in our laboratory of proto-oncogene abnormalities
in human tumors, we evaluated alterations of the HER-2/neu gene
in a large series of human primary breast cancers. Our results show
that amplification of this gene occurs relatively frequently in breast
cancer, and that it is associated with disease relapse and overall
patient survival.
Factors that are known to be important in the prognosis of breast
malignancies in individual patients include: size of the primary
tumor, stage of disease at diagnosis, hormonal receptor status, and
number of axillary lymph nodes involved with disease (positive
nodes) (29). The current study, which was conducted in two parts,
involved the evaluation of tissue from 189 separate breast malignan-
cies that were part of a breast cancer study ongoing at the University
of Texas, San Antonio. This cohort of tumors was of interest
because considerable information was available on the majority of
the specimens including size of the primary tumor, estrogen recep-
tor status, progesterone receptor status, age ofpatient, disease stage,
and status of the axillary lymph nodes.
In the initial survey, tissue from 103 primary breast cancers was
evaluated for alterations in the HER-2/neu gene. DNA from
individual tumors was prepared as described (30), digested with
Eco RI, and subjected to Southern blot analysis with a 32P-labeled
HER-2/neu-1 probe, which is known to detect a 13-kb hybridizing
band in human DNA (22). Examples of tumors from the initial
survey are shown in Fig. 1. Of the 103 samples examined, 19 (18%)
showed evidence of HER-2/neu gene amplification. The degree of
amplification in individual cases was determined by dilution analysis
(Fig. 2A), as well as soft laser densitometry scanning. To determine
that the amount of DNA loaded in each lane was equivalent, all
filters were washed and rehybridized with a 32P-labeled arginase
gene probe (31). This probe identifies a 15-kb hybridizing band on
Eco RI-digested human DNA, and was selected as a control
because it more appropriately assesses the relative amount and

in a blinded fashion, in that they were made without knowledge of
disease parameters. Analysis ofthe data for association between gene
amplification and a number of disease parameters was then per-
formed.
Of 103 tumors evaluated in the initial survey, there was essentially
no correlation between gene amplification and estrogen receptor
status, progesterone receptor status, size of tumors, or age at
diagnosis (Table 1). However, when analysis was performed for
association between HER-2/neu amplification and number of posi-
tive lymph nodes, a trend was noted. This analysis showed that 4/34
(11%) of patients with no involved nodes, 2/20 (10%) with 1 to 3
involved nodes, and 8/25 (32%) with >3 involved nodes had gene
amplification (P = 0.11). Ifthese data were examined by comparing
0 to 3 positive nodes versus >3 positive nodes, the correlation with
gene amplification became more significant (P < 0.05). Thus, there
was a significant increase in incidence of HER-2/neu gene amplifica-
tion in patients with >3 axillary lymph nodes involved with disease.
A multivariate regression analysis to correlate HER-2/neu amplifica-
tion with various disease parameters identified the number of
positive nodes as the only significant factor, either alone or in
combination, to correlate with amplification.
This initial study indicated that it might be possible to discrimi-
nate among node-positive patients on the basis of HER-2/neu gene

amplification. It is well known that the number of positive nodes is
the best prognostic factor for disease recurrence and survival in
patients with breast cancer (29). Given .the correlation between
number of nodes positive and HER-2/neu amplification, one might
predict that amplification of this gene might also have some
7002
prognostic value. No long-term follow-up data, however, were
available on the 103 patients analyzed in the initial study. For this
reason, a second study was conducted on 100 breast cancer samples ,51
from patients with positive axillary lymph nodes. All of the informa-
yraunaJ
tion available for the first group of 103 patients was available for
these patients. In addition, relapse and survival information was
available, since these cases had a median follow-up of 46 months
(range 24 to 86 months). Of these 100 samples, 86 yielded sufficient no
DNA for study. Amplification of the HER-2/neu gene was mea- gro.gamecneics.www
sured as in the initial survey, and examples of tumors from this study
are shown (Fig. 1). Amplification was found in 34/86 (40%) of
these patients. For this larger sample of node-positive patients,
several statistically significant or nearly significant relationships were
observed. In agreement with the preliminary survey, there was an
association between number of involved lymph nodes and HER-2/
neu amplification (Table 2). In addition, the presence of gene
amplification was correlated with estrogen receptor status and size
of primary tumor (Table 2). Together, these two surveys yielded morf
data on 189 patients and the association of HER-2/neu amplifica-
tion with various disease parameters in the combined group is dedaolnwoD
shown in Table 3.

between HER-2/neu amplification and nodal status (P = 0.002)
indicated that information on amplification of this gene may
correlate with disease behavior; that is, recurrences and survival. To
test this, univariate survival analyses were performed in which
amplification was compared to relapse and survival in this patient
group. A total of 35 patients had a recurrence of the disease, and 29
had died at the time of the analyses. Median times to relapse and
death were 62 months and 69 months, respectively. The median
follow-up time for patients still alive was 47 months, ranging from
24 to 86 months. A total of 71 of the 86 patients (83%) received
some form of therapy after mastectomy: adjuvant systemic therapy
alone, 47%; adjuvant systemic therapy plus local radiation, 19%;
and local radiation alone, 17%. A strong and highly statistically
significant correlation was found between the degree of gene
amplification and both time to disease relapse (P = <0.0001) and
survival (P = 0.0011) (Table 4). Moreover, when compared in
univariate analyses to other parameters, amplification of HER-2/neu
was found to be superior to all other prognostic factors, with the
exception of the number of positive nodes (which it equaled) in
predicting time to relapse and overall survival in human breast
cancer (Table 4). The association between HER-2/neu amplification
and relapse and survival can be illustrated graphically in actuarial
survival curves (Fig. 3, A to D). While there was a somewhat
shortened time to relapse and shorter overall survival in patients
having any amplification of the HER-2/neu gene in their tumors
(Fig. 3, A and B), the greatest differences were found when
comparing patients with >5 copies of the gene to those without
amplification (single copy) (Fig. 3, C and D). Patients with greater
than five copies of HER-2/neu had even shorter disease-free survival
times (P = 0.015) and overall survival times (P = 0.06) when
compared to patients with no amplification. The phenomenon of
greater gene copy number correlating with a worse prognosis has
also been seen in evaluations of N-myc gene amplification in human
neuroblastomas (32).
To determine if amplification of HER-2/neu was independent of
other known prognostic factors in predicting disease behavior,
multivariate survival analyses were performed on the 86 node-
positive cases. Amplification of the gene continued to be a strong
prognostic factor, providing additional and independent predictive
information on both time to relapse and overall survival in these

account (Table 4).
Rearrangement of the HER-2/neu gene was rare. Ofthe total 189
tumors evaluated, three showed evidence of rearrangement, and in
two of the three cases, the rearrangement was identical (Fig. 1, cases
77 to 79). Also, two of the rearranged HER-2/neu loci were
amplified (Fig. 1, cases 78 and 79). The incidence of HER-2/neu

rearrangement as determined by Eco RI digestion was too small to
attempt statistical correlations.
To determine whether the phenomenon of amplification ofHER- ,51
21neu in breast cancer extended to related growth factor receptors, yraunaJ
all filters were analyzed with the EGFR probe (Fig. 4). Amplifica-
tion of the EGFR gene was found in 4/189 (2%) of the cases, and
rearrangement of the EGFR gene was found in one of those four
cases. The incidence of EGFR amplification and rearrangement was no

neu amplification (53/189 or 28%) with that of the EGFR gene
reveals the incidence of the former to be 14 times greater than that
of the latter, indicating that the phenomenon of gene amplification
is not a general one for a related tyrosine kinase-specific receptor in
human breast cancer. Moreover, studies examining alterations of
two other tyrosine kinase-specific proto-oncogenes, abi andfes, in
breast cancer did not show amplification of these genes (33).

tumors have been examined. In a survey of 121 primary breast
malignancies, amplification of the c-myc gene was found in 38
(32%) (34). Attempts to correlate c-myc gene amplification with
stage of disease, hormonal receptor status, histopathologic grade, or
axillary node metastases showed no association. There was a statisti-
cally significant association between c-myc amplification and agc at
diagnosis >50 years in a group of95 of these patients (34). Data on
relapse and survival were not presented in this study; however, there
was no correlation between c-myc amplification and nodal status to
indicate an association with disease behavior.
The exact role of various proto-oncogenes in the pathogenesis of
human malignancies remains unclear. One line of evidence implicat-
ing abnormalities of these genes in human disease is association of
their amplification with tumor progression in specific cancers. The
N-myc gene is frequently amplified in human neuroblastomas and
neuroblastoma cell lines (35, 36). Studies on the N-myc proto-
oncogene were the first to show a direct association between
abnormalities in a proto-oncogene and clinical behavior of a human
tumor. N-myc amplification and expression correlate both with stage
of disease and overall survival in patients with neuroblastoma (10,
32, 37). Moreover the greater the N-myc gene copy number, the
worse the patient prognosis for all stages of the disease (32). Taken
together, these data indicate a role for the N-myc gene in the
pathogenesis of neuroblastoma (32).
Neuroblastoma is a relatively rare disease with an incidence ofone
per 125,000 children. Carcinoma of the breast, however, is a
common malignancy affecting one ofevery 13 women in the United
States. There are 119,000 new cases per year, and approximately
40,000 women will die of the disease in 1986 (38). Current
treatment decisions for individual patients are frequently based on
specific prognostic parameters. The major prognostic factors for
breast cancer include presence or absence of tumor in the axillary
nodes, size of the primary tumor, and presence or absence of
hormonal receptors (29). The current study indicates that amplifica-
tion of the HER-2/neu gene is a significant predictor of both overall
survival and time to relapse in node-positive patients with breast
cancer. Amplification of the gene retains its prognostic significance
in multivariate analysis, even when adjustments are made for other
known prognostic factors. Moreover, amplification of HER-2/neu
has greater prognostic value than most currently used prognostic
fictors, including progesterone and estrogen receptors, and is
equivalent to and independent of the best known prognosticator-
number of positive lymph nodes. Finally, the degree of HER-2/neu
amplification appears to have an effect on survival, with greater copy
number being associated with a worse prognosis (Fig. 3, C and D).
A similar phenomenon has been observed for N-myc gene amplifica-
tion in human neuroblastoma (32).
The potential role of HER-2/neu in the pathogenesis of breast
cancer is unknown. Like N-myc, the correlation of HER-2/neu Discussion Feb. 1, 2007

receptors in the biology of breast cancer is well established (29, 39,
40). It is easy to speculate that a gene encoding a putative growth
factor receptor, when expressed in inappropriate amounts, may give
a growth advantage to the cells expressing it. Alternatively, alter-
ation in the gene product itself may lead to a critical change in the
receptor protein. A single point mutation in the transmembrane
domain of the protein encoded by the rat neu oncogene appears to
be all that is necessary for the gene to gain transforming ability (41).

Whether this or a similar alteration is found in the amplified HER-
21neu gene in human breast cancer will require sequence analysis of
the homologous region in the amplified human gene. In addition, ,51
studies evaluating the expression of this gene at the RNA and/or yraunaJ
protein level will prove important in determining if HER-2/neu
amplification results in an expected increased gene expression. The
question of amplification of HER-2/neu in metastatic as compared
to primary lesions in a given patient is important. The current study no
utilized only primary breast tumors for analyses. It would be of gro.gamecneics.www
interest to determine if HER-2/neu copy number is altered as the
tumor metastasizes. A recent study evaluating N-myc copy number
in human small cell carcinoma of the lung showed no difference
between primary and metastatic lesions (11).
The initial survey from the current study showed that 15% of
breast cancer patients with stage I disease (node-negative) have
HER-2/ncu amplification. Unfortunately, no long-term follow-up
data were available for these patients. This stage I setting may be an
additional group in which HER-2/neu measurements will have an morf
impact in predicting biologic behavior of the tumor, and as a result,
in design of treatment strategy. Finally, if the HER-2/neu gene dedaolnwoD
product functions as a growth factor receptor that plays a role in the
pathogenesis of breast cancer, identification of its ligand and
development of specific antagonists could have important therapeu-
tic implications.

P OICORNAVIRUSES (1) COMPRISE A LARGE FAMILY OF SINGLE-
stranded RNA-containing animal viruses. They have been
dassified into four genera on the basis of physical properties
of the virions: (i) cardioviruses, such as encephalomyocarditis virus
(EMCV), Theiler's murine encephalitis virus, and Mengo virus; (ii)
enteroviruses, such poliovirus, hepatitis A virus, and Coxsackie
as
virus; (iii) aphthoviruses, such as foot-and-mouth disease viruses
(FMDV); and (iv) rhinoviruses, of which there are about 100
serotypes. The physiological consequences of picomavirus infection
are highly variable because ofdiffering tissue tropism, differing viral
stability in acid environment, and differing responses by infected
host cells. Among the murine cardioviruses (2), for example, Mengo
virus can produce fatal encephalitis, a strain of EMCV can cause
diabetes, and a strain ofTheiler's virus can cause chronic demyelinat-
ing disease.
