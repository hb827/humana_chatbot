        "thinking": "Okay, the user wants me to generate a question about breast cancer. Let me think about what's important in that context.\n\nFirst, I should consider the common aspects of breast cancer. It's a serious condition, so the question needs to be specific and cover various angles. Maybe start with the causes? Like, what is the most common cause of breast cancer? Or what are the risk factors?\n\nThen, there's the progression of the disease. How does it develop over time? Or what are the symptoms people might experience?\n\nAlso, the treatment options are crucial. Maybe the question should ask about the latest treatments or the impact of early detection.\n\nI need to make sure the question is clear and covers different aspects. Let me check if there's any specific angle the user might be interested in. Since the question is about breast cancer, it could cover causes, symptoms, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the question should be open-ended to allow for a comprehensive answer. Let me phrase it in a way that's not too technical but still informative. Maybe something like, \"What are the most common causes and risk factors for developing breast cancer, and what are the key symptoms people might experience?\" That should cover the main points.",
